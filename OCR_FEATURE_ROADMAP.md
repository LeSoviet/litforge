# OCR Scanning Feature Roadmap for LitForge

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation plan for adding OCR (Optical Character Recognition) scanning functionality to the LitForge app, allowing users to scan physical documents and convert them into digital text documents.

## Phase 1: Research and Setup (Week 1)

### 1.1 Dependency Selection
- [ ] Choose an appropriate OCR library for React Native/Expo:
  - Option A: [expo-ocr](https://github.com/barthap/expo-ocr) - MLKit/Vision based OCR for Expo
  - Option B: [react-native-mlkit-ocr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-mlkit-ocr) - Google MLKit text recognition
  - Option C: [expo-text-extractor](https://github.com/pchalupa/expo-text-extractor) - Text extraction using Google ML Kit and Apple Vision

### 1.2 Environment Setup
- [ ] Install the selected OCR library
- [ ] Configure necessary permissions in app.json:
  - Camera permissions
  - Photo library permissions
- [ ] Update Expo configuration if needed (EAS Build requirements)

### 1.3 Permissions Implementation
- [ ] Add camera permission requests
- [ ] Implement permission handling UI
- [ ] Add necessary permission descriptions in app.json

## Phase 2: Core OCR Functionality (Week 2)

### 2.1 Camera Integration
- [ ] Create a camera view component for document scanning
- [ ] Implement image capture functionality
- [ ] Add basic camera controls (flash, focus, etc.)

### 2.2 OCR Processing Service
- [ ] Create [OcrService.ts](file:///c:/Users/TeamOS/Desktop/Projects/Litforge/services/DocumentService.ts) to handle OCR operations
- [ ] Implement text extraction from captured images
- [ ] Add error handling for OCR processing failures

### 2.3 Text Processing
- [ ] Clean and format extracted text
- [ ] Implement basic text enhancement (removing artifacts, fixing line breaks)
- [ ] Add text validation to ensure quality results

## Phase 3: UI Implementation (Week 3)

### 3.1 OCR Scan Screen
- [ ] Create a dedicated OCR scanning screen
- [ ] Add camera preview with scanning overlay
- [ ] Implement capture button and retake functionality

### 3.2 Results Display
- [ ] Create a screen to display OCR results
- [ ] Add text editing capabilities
- [ ] Implement save as document functionality

### 3.3 Integration with Document System
- [ ] Add OCR scan option to the main import flow
- [ ] Create document from OCR text
- [ ] Integrate with existing [DocumentService.ts](file:///c:/Users/TeamOS/Desktop/Projects/Litforge/services/DocumentService.ts)

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)

### 4.1 Document Processing
- [ ] Implement multi-page document scanning
- [ ] Add image preprocessing for better OCR accuracy
- [ ] Support different document types and layouts

### 4.2 Text Enhancement
- [ ] Add spell checking for extracted text
- [ ] Implement language detection
- [ ] Add text formatting options

### 4.3 Performance Optimization
- [ ] Optimize OCR processing for speed
- [ ] Implement caching for processed documents
- [ ] Add offline capabilities where possible

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement (Week 5)

### 5.1 Quality Assurance
- [ ] Test OCR accuracy with various document types
- [ ] Verify performance on different device types
- [ ] Test edge cases and error scenarios

### 5.2 User Experience
- [ ] Gather feedback on scanning workflow
- [ ] Optimize UI/UX based on user testing
- [ ] Improve scanning guidance and instructions

### 5.3 Documentation
- [ ] Create user documentation for OCR feature
- [ ] Update developer documentation
- [ ] Add inline code comments and type definitions

## Technical Implementation Details

### Required Dependencies
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    // One of the following OCR libraries:
    "expo-ocr": "^latest",
    // OR
    "react-native-mlkit-ocr": "^latest",
    // OR
    "expo-text-extractor": "^latest",
    
    // Additional required libraries:
    "expo-camera": "~15.0.16",
    "expo-media-library": "~17.0.3",
    "expo-image-manipulator": "~13.0.5"
  }
}
```

### Permissions Needed
```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "camera",
    "mediaLibrary",
    "photoLibrary"
  ]
}
```

### File Structure

## Integration Points

### With Existing Document System
- OCR results will be converted to markdown documents
- Documents will be stored using existing [DocumentService.ts](file:///c:/Users/TeamOS/Desktop/Projects/Litforge/services/DocumentService.ts) functionality
- All existing document features (bookmarks, notes, progress tracking) will work with OCR documents

### With Existing UI
- Add OCR option to document import flow
- Integrate with existing theme and styling system
- Maintain consistent navigation patterns

## Success Metrics

### Performance
- OCR processing time under 5 seconds for standard documents
- Accuracy rate above 90% for printed text
- Memory usage optimized for mobile devices

### User Experience
- Simple, intuitive scanning workflow
- Clear guidance for optimal scanning conditions
- Fast access to editable text results

## Potential Challenges

### Technical
- Ensuring consistent OCR accuracy across different lighting conditions
- Managing large image files and processing requirements
- Handling various document layouts and text orientations

### Platform Specific
- iOS vs Android differences in camera APIs
- Permissions handling across platforms
- Performance optimization for different device capabilities
