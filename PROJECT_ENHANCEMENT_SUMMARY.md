# Project Enhancement Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the major enhancements and cleanups performed on the LitForge project to improve maintainability and reduce complexity.

## 1. OCR Functionality Removal

### Reason for Removal
- The `react-native-mlkit-ocr` library is outdated and no longer maintained
- Android permission changes in Expo Go caused critical runtime errors
- Library was difficult to implement and maintain properly

### Files Removed
- `services/OcrService.ts`
- `types/OcrTypes.ts`
- `app/ocr-scanner.tsx`

### Dependencies Removed
- Removed `react-native-mlkit-ocr` from package.json

### Configuration Changes
- Removed camera permissions from app.json
- Removed OCR-related navigation routes from app/_layout.tsx

### Code Cleanup
- Removed OCR-related strings from LanguageContext
- Removed OCR-related imports and methods from DocumentService
- Removed OCR UI elements from the index screen
- Updated README.md to remove OCR references

## 2. Sample Stories Reduction

### Reason for Reduction
- Reduced sample story files from 131 to 10 for better project management
- Improved app loading performance
- Simplified project structure

### Files Kept (10 files)
1. 100_stories_plan.md
2. A_Cry_for_Freedom.md
3. Inherit_the_Wind.md
4. README.md
5. Socialism_with_a_Human_Face.md
6. The_Able_Archer_83_War_Scare.md
7. The_Abolitionists_Voice.md
8. The_Age_of_Discovery.md
9. The_Age_of_Smoke_and_Steam.md
10. The_Angel_of_Mons.md

### Files Removed
- 121 story files were deleted to reduce the sample set

### Code Updates
- Updated stories.tsx to only reference the 10 remaining files
- Cleaned up the storyAssets mapping to match the reduced file set

## 3. Benefits of These Changes

### Improved Maintainability
- Removed outdated and problematic dependencies
- Simplified codebase by eliminating complex OCR implementation
- Reduced project complexity with fewer sample files

### Enhanced Stability
- Eliminated runtime errors related to OCR functionality
- Removed dependency on unmaintained libraries
- Improved app performance with fewer assets to load

### Better Developer Experience
- Cleaner project structure
- Easier to navigate and understand codebase
- Reduced build times with fewer assets

## 4. Future Considerations

### Alternative OCR Solutions
If OCR functionality is needed in the future, consider:
- Using Expo's built-in camera and image processing capabilities
- Implementing a cloud-based OCR service (e.g., Google Cloud Vision)
- Using a more modern and actively maintained OCR library

### Content Management
- The reduced set of 10 sample stories provides a good balance between demonstration and performance
- Additional stories can be added as needed for specific use cases

## Enhancements Summary

### 1. Security Fixes
- **Issue**: Moderate severity vulnerability in `react-native-markdown-display`
- **Solution**: Replaced `react-native-markdown-display` with `@cosmicmedia/react-native-markdown-display`
