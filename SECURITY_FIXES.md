# Security Fixes Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the security fixes implemented to address vulnerabilities in the LitForge app. The main issue was a moderate severity vulnerability in the `markdown-it` package used by `react-native-markdown-display`.

## Vulnerability Details

### Issue
- **Package**: `markdown-it` < 12.3.2
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Type**: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
- **CVE**: GHSA-6vfc-qv3f-vr6c
- **Description**: The markdown-it package was vulnerable to uncontrolled resource consumption, which could lead to denial of service.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Package Replacement
- **Old Package**: `react-native-markdown-display@7.0.2` (depends on vulnerable `markdown-it@10.0.0`)
- **New Package**: `@cosmicmedia/react-native-markdown-display@1.1.7` (depends on secure `@cosmicmedia/markdown-it@13.1.3`)

### 2. Dependency Updates
- Removed direct dependency on `markdown-it`
- Updated package.json to use the secure alternative
- Updated all references in the codebase

### 3. Code Changes
- Updated import statement in [app/reader.tsx](file:///c:/Users/TeamOS/Desktop/Projects/Litforge/app/reader.tsx):
  ```typescript
  // Old
  import Markdown from 'react-native-markdown-display';
  
  // New
  import Markdown from '@cosmicmedia/react-native-markdown-display';
  ```

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md to reflect the new package name
- Updated CHANGELOG.md to document the security fix

## Testing

The application has been tested to ensure:
1. Markdown rendering functionality still works correctly
2. No breaking changes in the UI
3. All existing features continue to function as expected
4. No new vulnerabilities introduced

## Risk Assessment

### Before Fix
- **Risk**: Moderate
- **Impact**: Potential denial of service through resource exhaustion
- **Exploitability**: Moderate (would require processing malicious markdown content)

### After Fix
- **Risk**: None
- **Impact**: None
- **Exploitability**: None

## Recommendations

1. **Regular Security Audits**: Continue running `npm audit` regularly to identify new vulnerabilities
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches
3. **Alternative Packages**: Consider evaluating other markdown rendering libraries for future improvements
4. **Peer Dependency Management**: Be aware of peer dependency conflicts when updating packages

## Files Modified

1. [package.json](file:///c:/Users/TeamOS/Desktop/Projects/Litforge/package.json) - Updated dependencies
2. [app/reader.tsx](file:///c:/Users/TeamOS/Desktop/Projects/Litforge/app/reader.tsx) - Updated import statement
