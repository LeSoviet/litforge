# The Year of Three Kings

## Chapter 1: The Passing of the Saint

In the cold, damp halls of Westminster in January of 1066, the world was holding its breath. King Edward the Confessor, a man more monk than monarch, lay dying. He was a saintly figure, but he had left his kingdom of England in a perilous state: he was childless.

Huscarl Erik of Wessex stood guard outside the royal chambers, his hand resting on the familiar, worn pommel of his broadsword. At thirty, he was a veteran of a dozen campaigns against the Welsh and the Scots, a member of the elite household guard of the most powerful man in England, Harold Godwinson, the Earl of Wessex. Erik was a man of simple, bedrock loyalties. He was loyal to his lord, Harold, and through him, to the kingdom of England. He listened to the whispers of the courtiers, the talk of the rival claimants to the throne: the boy-prince Edgar, the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada, and, most ominously, Duke William of Normandy, who claimed the sainted king had once promised him the throne. Erik spat quietly onto the rushes. The throne of England was not a gift to be given away to foreigners. It belonged to the English, and there was no man more English, or more capable, than his lord, Harold. When the news finally came that the dying king had, with his last breath, named Harold as his successor, Erik felt a surge of grim satisfaction. The Witan, the council of great lords, had confirmed it. The matter was settled.

In the bustling, timber-framed city of Rouen, the capital of Normandy, Isabelle de Brienne heard the news with a sense of righteous fury. At eighteen, she was the daughter of one of Duke William's most trusted barons, her life a tapestry of courtly manners, political ambition, and the unshakeable belief in the sanctity of an oath. She had been present, two years earlier, when the shipwrecked Earl Harold had been a "guest" at William's court. She had seen him, with her own eyes, swear a holy oath on the bones of saints to support William's claim to the English throne. To Isabelle, Harold's coronation was not just a political betrayal; it was a mortal sin, a blasphemous act of perjury that cried out to heaven for vengeance. Her own betrothed, a young, ambitious knight named Robert Malet, was already sharpening his sword. She knew, with a certainty that was both thrilling and terrifying, that her Duke would not let this insult stand. He would cross the sea. He would take what was his by right.

Far to the north, in the windswept Orkney islands, a third man heard the news and smiled, a predator's thin, cruel smile. Tostig Godwinson, Harold's own exiled brother, saw not a crisis, but an opportunity. He had been the Earl of Northumbria, but his own people had risen up against his tyrannical rule, and his brother Harold had supported the rebels, casting him out. The bitterness was a poison in his blood. He had lost his lands, his power, his honor. Now, with the kingdom in turmoil, he would have his revenge. He would find allies. He would burn his brother's kingdom to the ground. He would be a king, or he would see England drown in blood.

## Chapter 2: The Star of Ill Omen

In the spring, a new and terrifying actor appeared in the heavens. A star with a long, fiery tail, what would later be known as Halley's Comet, blazed across the night sky.

In England, it was seen as a terrible omen. The common people were gripped by a superstitious dread. In the monasteries, the monks looked at the celestial portent and saw a sign of God's wrath, a premonition of war and the fall of kings. Erik saw the fear in the faces of his fellow soldiers. Even the new king, Harold, a man of immense personal courage, was said to be deeply troubled by the "hairy star." It felt as if the heavens themselves were conspiring against their new kingdom.

In Normandy, the same comet was interpreted as a sign of divine favor. Priests in William's court preached that it was a promise of victory, a heavenly endorsement of the Duke's righteous cause. For Isabelle, it was a confirmation. God was with them. She spent her days in the convent, sewing the great banners that would fly from the masts of the invasion fleet, her needle stitching lions and crosses, symbols of the holy war to come. She watched the preparations with a growing sense of awe. An entire forest was being felled to build the fleet of nearly seven hundred ships. Knights, mercenaries, and adventurers from all over France were flocking to William's standard, drawn by the promise of English land and the Pope's blessing, which William had cleverly secured.

## Chapter 3: The Northern Fury

Tostig, the exile, found his ally in the most feared warrior of the age: Harald Hardrada, the King of Norway, a giant of a man who had fought as a mercenary in the Varangian Guard of Constantinople and had carved out a kingdom for himself through sheer, brutal force. Tostig, with his honeyed, poison-tipped words, convinced Hardrada that England was ripe for the taking, that the people of the north, his former earldom, would rise up to support them.

In early September, the Norwegian fleet, over 300 ships strong, a true Viking armada, descended on the coast of Northumbria. They sailed up the Humber and Ouse rivers, and at the Battle of Fulford Gate, they crushed the army of the northern English earls. The city of York, the capital of the north, surrendered to them.

In a small village just outside the city, Father Michael, the parish priest, huddled with his terrified flock in the stone church. He had seen the smoke from the battlefield. He had seen the wounded, streaming back from the defeat. Now, the Norsemen were the masters. He watched them from the church door, huge, bearded men, their horned helmets and battle-axes like something from a nightmare. They were pagans in all but name, and they took what they wanted: food, livestock, and silver from his church's small treasury. He prayed, not for victory, but for simple survival.

## Chapter 4: The March of the Huscarls

King Harold was in the south, his army, the *fyrd*, mustered on the coast of Sussex, watching the Channel for William's invasion. For weeks, the wind had blown from the north, pinning the Norman fleet in its harbor. Then, the devastating news from the north arrived. A forced march of nearly two hundred miles in just four days. It was an almost superhuman feat of logistics and endurance.

Erik was on that march. It was a blur of dust, sweat, and aching muscles. They marched from dawn till dusk, stopping only for a few hours of exhausted, dreamless sleep. They ate their rations on the move. The speed was everything. They had to catch the Vikings by surprise. As they marched, their numbers swelled, the local militias of the Midlands joining their column. Erik saw the look on Harold's face. He was a king in motion, a whirlwind of energy, his personal magnetism holding the army together. But Erik also saw the strain. This was a terrible gamble. By racing north to save one part of his kingdom, he was leaving the south completely exposed.

## Chapter 5: The Bridge of Blood

On September 25th, Harold's army reached the outskirts of York. The Norwegians, camped at a place called Stamford Bridge, were completely unprepared. They were celebrating their victory, many of them not even wearing their mail-shirts in the autumn sun.

The battle was a legend in the making. The Saxons fell upon the surprised Norsemen with a disciplined fury. The battle raged for hours, a brutal, grinding affair of shield wall against shield wall, of the bite of the axe and the thrust of the spear. Erik fought in the front rank, his shield splintered, his arm numb from the shock of repeated blows. He saw Tostig Godwinson, the traitor, cut down in the chaos. He saw the giant Hardrada, a berserker in the fray, finally fall with a Saxon arrow in his throat. The Viking army, leaderless, broke and fled. The victory was total, a stunning, bloody triumph.

Father Michael and his parishioners emerged from their hiding places to a landscape of carnage. The river, it was said, ran red with blood. They tended to the wounded, Saxon and Norse alike, their common humanity a small, fragile light in the aftermath of the slaughter. The northern threat had been utterly destroyed. But the cost had been immense. Harold's army, the finest army in England, was battered, wounded, and exhausted.

## Chapter 6: The Southern Wind

Three days later, as Harold was celebrating his victory in York, a messenger arrived, his horse lathered, his face pale with exhaustion. The wind had changed. William's fleet had landed at Pevensey. The Normans were on English soil.

The news was a physical blow. Erik saw the color drain from his king's face. There was no time to rest, no time to savor their victory. They had to turn around and march another two hundred and fifty miles south. The army, already depleted, began the long, grueling journey back. Men deserted, their duty done, their farms calling them home. The core of the army, the professional huscarls like Erik, remained, their loyalty to their king absolute, but their bodies were screaming with fatigue.

## Chapter 7: The Hill of the Grey Apple Tree

On the evening of October 13th, Harold's army reached a ridge of high ground called Senlac Hill, a few miles from Hastings. The name, in the old tongue, meant "lake of blood." Harold chose his ground carefully. He would fight a defensive battle. He would form his army into a shield wall, an interlocking, impenetrable barrier of shields and spears, and he would force the Normans to attack him uphill.

Erik stood on the ridge that evening and looked down at the valley below. He could see the campfires of the Norman army, a vast, confident city of lights. He knew they were fresh, well-fed, and had a core of heavy cavalry and a host of archers, weapons the Saxons lacked. He looked at his own comrades. They were the best fighters in the world, but they were bone-weary, their numbers a fraction of what they had been a month ago. He saw his king, a giant of a man, walking the lines, his voice calm, his presence a source of strength. But Erik knew. This would be a battle fought on courage and exhaustion.

In the Norman camp, Isabelle knelt in her tent, praying for her betrothed, Robert. She had crossed the Channel with the army, a testament to her own iron will and her faith in William's cause. She could hear the sounds of the camp: the ring of the blacksmith's hammer, the neighing of the warhorses, the low murmur of the priests chanting Mass. She felt no fear, only a profound, righteous certainty. God had given them the wind. He had delivered their enemies into their hands. Tomorrow, he would deliver them a kingdom.

## Chapter 8: The Shield Wall

The battle began at nine o'clock on the morning of October 14th. It opened with a volley of Norman arrows, which rattled harmlessly off the high-held Saxon shields. Then came the infantry, struggling up the slope, only to be repulsed by the disciplined wall of spears.

Then came the pride of the Norman army: the charge of the heavy knights. Isabelle, watching from a distant hill, saw the magnificent, terrible spectacle. A wave of steel and horseflesh, lances couched, thundered up the hill. Erik, in the front rank of the shield wall, braced himself. The impact was a physical shock that shuddered through his entire body. Horses screamed, men shouted, the air was filled with the splintering of wood and the crunch of bone. But the wall held. The knights were thrown back, their charge broken on the rock of the Saxon line. For hours, the pattern was repeated. The Normans would attack, and the shield wall would hold.

## Chapter 9: The Fatal Arrow

As the day wore on, the Normans, growing desperate, employed a new tactic. They would charge, and then, in a disciplined maneuver, they would feign a retreat. The less experienced men of the Saxon *fyrd*, believing the enemy was truly fleeing, broke from the wall and charged down the hill in a disorganized pursuit. The Norman knights would then turn and cut them to pieces in the open.

Harold, seeing his line being weakened, rode along the ridge, roaring at his men to hold their position. Erik, his body a mass of bruises, his shield a splintered wreck, held his ground. The wall, though thinner now, was still unbroken.

As the autumn sun began to sink, William ordered his archers to fire a high, arcing volley, to rain their arrows down on the heads of the Saxon warriors. It was one of these arrows, falling from the sky like a cruel bolt of fate, that struck King Harold in the eye. He fell, mortally wounded, at the foot of his own royal standard.

The news of the king's death spread like a poison through the Saxon line. Their will, already stretched to the breaking point, finally snapped. The shield wall disintegrated. The Normans surged up the hill. The battle turned into a slaughter. Erik saw his king fall. He saw his comrades, the men he had fought beside for a decade, cut down. He fought with the fury of a man with nothing left to lose, until a Norman sword blow to his head sent him into a black, silent darkness.

## Chapter 10: The New Kingdom

Erik awoke days later in a peasant's hovel, his head bandaged, his world a ruin. He was a man without a king, without a country. He would eventually escape to the fens of East Anglia, a ghost of a defeated England, joining the long, simmering, and ultimately doomed resistance against the new masters.

William the Conqueror marched on London. On Christmas Day, 1066, in Westminster Abbey, the church of the sainted king he claimed to succeed, he was crowned King of England.

Isabelle de Brienne's betrothed had survived the battle. He was granted the lands of a dead Saxon thegn in Yorkshire. She arrived to be the lady of a stone castle, looking out over a land that was green and rich, but whose people looked at her with a sullen, silent hatred. She was a conqueror, a mistress in a foreign land.

Father Michael's village now had a new lord, a Norman knight who spoke no English. A new, harsh feudal order was being imposed. The old Anglo-Saxon aristocracy was being systematically replaced. The language of the court, of the law, of power, was now French.

The year 1066 was not just a change of king. It was a national trauma, a moment that shattered a culture and reforged it into something new. The old, Germanic, sea-facing England was gone. A new, French-speaking, Europe-facing England had been born, its foundations laid on a blood-soaked hill on a long and terrible autumn day.
