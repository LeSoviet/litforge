# The Proxy War

## Chapter 1: The Cuban Internationalist

**Lieutenant Felix**

Lieutenant Felix was a child of the Cuban Revolution. He had grown up in a country that had been transformed by Fidel Castro, a country that had thrown off the yoke of American imperialism, a country that had become a beacon of hope for the oppressed peoples of the world. He was a true believer, a man who was willing to fight and die for the cause of international socialism.

In 1975, he was sent to Angola, a country in southern Africa that had just won its independence from Portugal. But Angola was not at peace. It was in the throes of a brutal civil war, a war that was not just a local conflict, but a proxy war between the two superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union and Cuba supported the MPLA, the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, a Marxist-Leninist group that controlled the capital city of Luanda. The United States and South Africa supported UNITA and the FNLA, two rival anti-communist groups that were fighting to overthrow the MPLA.

Felix was one of the thousands of Cuban soldiers who were sent to Angola to fight alongside the MPLA. He was an internationalist, a man who believed that it was his revolutionary duty to help his comrades in Africa in their struggle against imperialism.

He was not a mercenary. He was a soldier in a regular army, a man who was fighting for a cause that he believed in. But he was also a stranger in a strange land, a man who was fighting a war that was not his own, a war that was being fought in a country that he did not know, for a people that he did not understand.

He was a Cuban in Africa, a pawn in a global chess match, a soldier in a proxy war.

## Chapter 2: The Angolan Rebel

**Jonas**

Jonas was a young man from the countryside of Angola, a member of the Ovimbundu ethnic group, the largest ethnic group in the country. He was a soldier in UNITA, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, a group that was led by the charismatic and controversial Jonas Savimbi.

He was not a communist. He was a nationalist, a man who was fighting for a free and independent Angola, an Angola that was not controlled by the Portuguese, by the Soviets, or by the Cubans. He saw the MPLA as a puppet of the Soviet Union, a group that was dominated by the Mbundu ethnic group, a group that was trying to impose a foreign ideology on his country.

He was fighting a guerrilla war, a war of hit-and-run attacks, of ambushes, of a constant and wearing struggle against a superior enemy. He was armed and trained by the South Africans, the pariah state of the apartheid regime, a strange and uncomfortable alliance that was born of a shared and desperate opposition to communism.

He was a freedom fighter, a man who was fighting for the soul of his country. But he was also a pawn in a game that was being played by others, a man whose fate was being decided in the capitals of the world, in Washington, in Moscow, in Pretoria.

He was Jonas, an Angolan rebel, and he was fighting against the Cuban internationalists in a war that was tearing his country apart.

## Chapter 3: The South African Mercenary

**Sergeant Botha**

Sergeant Botha was a soldier in the South African Defence Force, a man who was a product of the apartheid system, a man who believed in the superiority of the white race, a man who saw communism as a threat to his way of life, to his civilization, to his God.

He was a member of the 32 Battalion, a special forces unit that was made up of black and white soldiers, a unit that was known for its ruthlessness, its effectiveness, its willingness to do the dirty work of the apartheid regime.

He was sent to Angola to fight alongside UNITA, to support the anti-communist rebels, to create a buffer zone between the black-ruled states of Africa and the white-ruled bastion of South Africa.

He was a professional soldier, a man who was good at his job, a man who was not afraid of killing. He despised the Cubans, saw them as a bunch of communist fanatics who had no business being in Africa. He respected the Angolans, the black soldiers who fought alongside him, but he also saw them as inferiors, as children who needed the guidance and the protection of the white man.

He was a man who was fighting a secret and undeclared war, a war that his government denied was even happening. He was a mercenary, a soldier of fortune, a man who was fighting for a cause that was already lost, a cause that was doomed by the tide of history.

He was Sergeant Botha, a soldier of apartheid, and he was fighting in a proxy war that was a microcosm of the larger Cold War struggle.

## Chapter 4: The Battle of Cuito Cuanavale

The Angolan Civil War raged for more than a decade, a brutal and bloody conflict that claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people, that destroyed the country, that left a legacy of bitterness and division that would last for generations.

The war reached a climax in 1987, in the battle of Cuito Cuanavale, a small town in southern Angola that became the site of the largest and most decisive battle of the war.

It was a battle that pitted the Cuban and Angolan government forces against the South African and UNITA rebels. It was a battle that was fought with tanks, with artillery, with air power. It was a battle that was a conventional war, a set-piece battle that was a departure from the guerrilla warfare that had characterized the conflict for so long.

The battle was a stalemate. Both sides claimed victory, both sides suffered heavy losses. But it was a battle that changed the course of the war, a battle that had far-reaching political consequences.

It was a battle that convinced the South Africans that they could not win the war, that the cost of maintaining the apartheid system was too high. It was a battle that paved the way for the independence of Namibia, the release of Nelson Mandela, the end of apartheid.

It was a battle that convinced the Cubans that they could not achieve a military victory in Angola, that it was time to go home. It was a battle that marked the beginning of the end of Cubaâ€™s military involvement in Africa.

### Epilogue: The Legacy of the Proxy War

The Angolan Civil War was a classic proxy war of the Cold War era. It was a war that was fought by Angolans, but it was a war that was fueled by the weapons, the money, and the ideologies of the two superpowers.

It was a war that had no winners, only losers. The people of Angola were the biggest losers, their country destroyed, their lives shattered, their future mortgaged to the interests of foreign powers.

The legacy of the proxy war in Angola is a legacy of destruction, of division, of a country that is still struggling to recover from the ravages of a war that was not of its own making. It is a cautionary tale about the dangers of foreign intervention, of the cynical and often brutal way in which the great powers use smaller nations as pawns in their global chess match.

It is a reminder that the real victims of the Cold War were not the soldiers who fought in the front lines, but the ordinary people who were caught in the crossfire, the people whose lives were destroyed by a conflict that they did not start and that they could not control.
