# The Rape of Nanking

## Chapter 1: The Fall of the City

**Dr. Robert Wilson**

Dr. Robert Wilson, an American surgeon and missionary, stood on the rooftop of the University of Nanking Hospital, the sounds of war echoing through the ancient city. It was December 1937, and Nanking, the capital of Nationalist China, was falling. The Japanese Imperial Army, a relentless and brutal force, was pouring into the city, their guns spitting fire, their tanks rumbling through the streets.

He had chosen to stay, along with a handful of other Westerners, to protect the innocent, to bear witness to the unfolding horror. They had established a Safety Zone, a small area of the city that was supposed to be neutral territory, a sanctuary for the hundreds of thousands of Chinese civilians who were trapped in the besieged city.

But the Japanese paid no heed to the rules of war, to the sanctity of neutral zones, to the basic tenets of human decency. They were a conquering army, and they were unleashing a reign of terror upon the defenseless population.

Wilson saw the smoke rising from the burning buildings, heard the screams of the dying, felt the ground tremble beneath his feet as the bombs fell. He saw the refugees, a desperate and terrified stream of humanity, pouring into the Safety Zone, seeking shelter, seeking protection, seeking a miracle.

He worked tirelessly, often for twenty hours a day, treating the wounded, comforting the dying, trying to bring some semblance of order to the chaos. He saw the victims of the atrocities, the men who had been bayoneted, the women who had been raped, the children who had been orphaned.

He was a doctor, a man who had dedicated his life to healing, to saving lives. But he was also a man who was witnessing a level of brutality that defied all comprehension, a level of evil that threatened to shatter his very soul.

He was Robert Wilson, the European missionary, and he was about to witness the Rape of Nanking.

## Chapter 2: The Soldier’s Brutality

**Sergeant Tanaka**

Sergeant Tanaka was a soldier in the Japanese Imperial Army, a man who had been trained to be ruthless, to be disciplined, to be loyal to the Emperor. He had fought in Manchuria, had participated in the invasion of China, had seen the horrors of war, had learned to suppress his own humanity.

He believed in the superiority of the Japanese race, in the divine mission of Japan to conquer Asia, to establish a new order in the East. He saw the Chinese not as human beings, but as inferiors, as enemies, as obstacles to the glory of the Empire.

When Nanking fell, he was given free rein. He and his comrades were unleashed upon the city, ordered to loot, to rape, to kill. It was a reward for their bravery, a celebration of their victory, a demonstration of their power.

He participated in the mass killings, in the bayoneting of prisoners, in the beheading of civilians. He saw the fear in the eyes of his victims, the terror, the despair. But he felt no remorse, no pity, no compassion. He was a soldier, and he was doing his duty.

He saw the women, young and old, beautiful and plain, all reduced to objects of sexual gratification, to victims of a brutal and systematic campaign of rape. He saw the children, their innocent faces contorted by fear, their small bodies crushed under the treads of tanks.

He was a man who had been dehumanized by war, a man who had lost his own humanity in the pursuit of victory. He was a product of a system that glorified violence, that celebrated brutality, that taught its soldiers to see the enemy not as human beings, but as vermin.

He was Sergeant Tanaka, the Japanese soldier, and he was a perpetrator of the Rape of Nanking.

## Chapter 3: The Mother’s Despair

**Mei Lin**

Mei Lin was a young mother, a woman who had lived her entire life in Nanking, a place of quiet beauty, of ancient traditions, of a life that was both ordinary and precious. She had a husband, a small son, a home, a life that was filled with the simple joys of family, of community, of a deep and abiding love.

And then, the Japanese came. The sounds of war, of gunfire, of explosions, filled the air. Her city, her home, her life, was transformed into a nightmare.

She fled with her son, clutching him tightly, her heart pounding with fear. She sought refuge in the Safety Zone, a place that was supposed to be a sanctuary, a place where she and her son would be safe from the horrors of the war.

But the Safety Zone was not safe. The Japanese ignored its neutrality, raided it at will, dragged out men, women, and children, and subjected them to unspeakable atrocities.

She saw the brutality of the Japanese soldiers, the systematic violence, the senseless destruction. She saw her neighbors murdered, her friends raped, her city burned.

She lived in a constant state of terror, her body trembling, her mind numb with fear. She tried to protect her son, to shield him from the horrors, to keep him safe from the monsters who roamed the streets.

She was a woman who was caught in the middle, a victim of a war that was not her own, a war that was being fought by others on her soil. She did not care about politics, about ideologies, about the grand strategies of the generals. She cared only about her son, about his survival, about his future.

She was Mei Lin, the Chinese mother, and she was living through a nightmare.

### Epilogue: The Legacy of Nanking

The Rape of Nanking was one of the most horrific atrocities of World War II, a systematic campaign of mass murder, rape, and looting committed by the Japanese Imperial Army against the civilian population of Nanking, China, in December 1937. It is estimated that more than 300,000 Chinese civilians and unarmed soldiers were killed, and tens of thousands of women were raped.

Dr. Robert Wilson, the American missionary, continued to work in China, bearing witness to the atrocities, providing medical care, and documenting the horrors of the Rape of Nanking. His diaries and letters became a crucial source of information about the massacre, and he is remembered as a hero who risked his life to save others.

Sergeant Tanaka, the Japanese soldier, was never brought to justice for his crimes. He returned to Japan after the war, a man who had been dehumanized by his experiences, a man who carried the burden of his actions for the rest of his life.

Mei Lin, the Chinese mother, survived the Rape of Nanking, but she carried the scars of her experience for the rest of her life. She rebuilt her life, but she never forgot the horrors she had witnessed, the loved ones she had lost, the city that had been destroyed.

The legacy of the Rape of Nanking is a legacy of immense human suffering, of unimaginable brutality, of a profound and lasting impact on the history of China and Japan. It is a reminder that war is hell, that dehumanization can lead to unspeakable atrocities, that the human capacity for evil is boundless.

It is also a reminder of the importance of bearing witness, of remembering the past, of ensuring that such horrors are never repeated. The Rape of Nanking remains a controversial topic in Japan, with some denying or downplaying the extent of the atrocities. But for the Chinese people, and for many others around the world, it is a painful and undeniable truth, a wound that has yet to heal.
